    /* *** This method will generate and assign random images to buttons ***
    * First images are imported and stored in [8] array
    * Then 2-D array must be created with size 4x4 to store the randomly
      generated images
    * Each image must be assigned to 2 buttons
    * Linked images and button must be referred to by the same index
    *
    * 1) The process of this method is: to load images from directory,
      then generate a random number to associate every image to 2 indexes
      of the buttons array
     * The method should check if the random number is used before or not
     * Because 2-D array is used, the random number must be generated twice
       [row][coulomn]
     * 2) Another 2-D array of type ImageView  must be created to store buttons' images
     * 3) Finally, the method will return the 2-D array of ImageView
